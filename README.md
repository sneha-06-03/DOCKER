# Docker
**Docker** is a set of Platforms as a service (PaaS) products that use Operating system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than a virtual machine.<BR/>

# Key features of Docker:
**Containerization** :<br/>
Containerization is a virtualization technique that packages an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Docker is a popular containerization platform that allows developers to build, ship, and run containers. <br/>
<br/>
**Docker Hub**:<br/>
Docker Hub is a container registry built for developers and open source contributors to find, use, and share their container images. With Hub, developers can host public repos that can be used for free, or private repos for teams and enterprises.<br/>
<br/>
**Docker image**:<br/>
Docker image is a file that contains the instructions for running code in a Docker container<br/>
<br/>
**Dockerfile**:<br/>
Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image.<br/>
<br/>
**Orchestration**:<BR/>
Docker orchestration is a set of tools and practices that help manage Docker containers at scale.<BR/>
# Docker Commands
Through introducing the essential docker commands, docker became a powerful software in streamlining the container management process. It helps in ensuring a seamless development and deployment workflows. The following are the some of docker commands that are used commonly:
<br/>
<br/>
**Docker Run**: It used for launching the containers from images, with specifying the runtime options and commands.<br/>
<br/>
**Docker Pull**: It fetches the container images from the container registry like Docker Hub to the local machine.<br/>
<br/>
**Docker ps** : It helps in displaying the running containers along with their important information like container ID, image used and status.<br/>
<br/>
**Docker Stop** : It helps in halting the running containers gracefully shutting down the processes within them.<br/>
<br/>
**Docker Start**: It helps in restarting the stopped containers, resuming their operations from the previous state.<br/>
<br/>
**Docker Login**: It helps to login in to the docker registry enabling the access to private repositories.<br/>
<br/>
# Container in Docker
A Docker container is a package that contains all the components required to run an application, including the code, dependencies, and libraries. Docker containers are lightweight and portable, and can run on any system that has a Linux or Windows operating system.<br/>
<br/>
**Here are some benefits of Docker containers**: <br/>
<br/>
**Lightweight**: Containers share the same operating system kernel as the machine they're running on, so they don't need their own operating system. <br/>
<br/>
**Secure**: Applications are safer when running in containers. <br/>
<br/>
**Portable**: Containers can be moved to any system that runs Linux or Windows. <br/>
