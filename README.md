# Docker
**Docker** is a set of Platforms as a service (PaaS) products that use Operating system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than a virtual machine.
# Docker Commands
Through introducing the essential docker commands, docker became a powerful software in streamlining the container management process. It helps in ensuring a seamless development and deployment workflows. The following are the some of docker commands that are used commonly:

**Docker Run**: It used for launching the containers from images, with specifying the runtime options and commands.<br/>
**Docker Pull**: It fetches the container images from the container registry like Docker Hub to the local machine.<br/>
**Docker ps** : It helps in displaying the running containers along with their important information like container ID, image used and status.<br/>
**Docker Stop** : It helps in halting the running containers gracefully shutting down the processes within them.<br/>
**Docker Start**: It helps in restarting the stopped containers, resuming their operations from the previous state.<br/>
**Docker Login**: It helps to login in to the docker registry enabling the access to private repositories.<br/>
